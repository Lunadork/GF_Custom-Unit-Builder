# GF_Custom-Unit-Builder
Basic custom unit builder for grimdark future because I'm tired of using a spreadsheet

Front end only at the moment.  Will allow user to make a custom unit, give it a name then export a JSON or an image of the unit card.

Future goals will include importing a saved/exported unit, maybe later a login system, saving and sharing of custom units and potentially a list builder that supports them and sharing of lists amongst other users.
